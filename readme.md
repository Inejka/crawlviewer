# About
The main purpose of this project is to give you a simple app to save a bunch of sites on your hard drive and then view them easily. Maybe later I will add the ability to start crawlers from this app. 
# Currently supported crawlers
 - [nudecrawler](https://github.com/yaroslaff/nudecrawler)
# Usage
Well, for now there is nothing to use.
